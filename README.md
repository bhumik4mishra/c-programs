# C Programming Practice

This folder contains my daily practice programs in the **C programming language**.  
Each file solves a specific problem statement and is self-contained with:
- Problem Statement (as comments at the top of the file)
- Approach / Logic used
- Complete C code
- Sample Input & Output

## Goals
- Practice C programming concepts such as loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and structures.
- Improve problem-solving skills by solving one problem every day.
- Maintain clean, well-documented code that can be understood later.

## Structure
- Each `.c` file contains:
  1. Problem Statement (in comments)
  2. Constraints (if any)
  3. Step-by-step logic
  4. Full C code

## How to Run
1. Open the `.c` file in any C compiler (e.g., GCC, Turbo C, or online compiler).
2. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o program
